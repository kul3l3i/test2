    <p class="p2">Basketball</p>
    <p class="p2">
        <mark>Basketball</mark> is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one 
            another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 
            9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 
            10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court), while preventing the opposing team from 
            shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point 
            line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a 
            technical foul is given one, two, or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end 
            of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) 
            is mandated.

                    Shooting is the most important skill in basketball. The fundamental skills of passing, dribbling, 
                    defense, and rebounding may enable you to get a high percentage shot, but you must still be able 
                    to make the shot. A large part of shooting is mental attitude. In addition to shooting skill, you
                    must have confidence in yourself to shoot well. The integration of the mental and mechanical 
                    aspects of shooting fosters shooting success.<button>Shooting</button></p>

                <p class="p5">
                Passing in basketball is the act of throwing the ball to a teammate. 
                One player will try to pass the ball to their teammate while the other
                 player tries to steal the ball and take it away. We are all aware that 
                 passing the ball successfully among the players is one of the keys in a basketball game. 
                 But what are the types of passing in basketball? What does it mean? And why do we need them in court?
                 Basketball is one of the most popular sports in the world. Though it has many variations, there are basic 
                 basketball passing techniques that even beginners can learn to improve their game. <br>

                <h2>Defending</h2>
                <p class="p6">
                A basketball defense refers to the defensive strategies, alignments, and positioning that
                a team uses to prevent the opposing offense from scoring baskets. In basketball, good defense 
                requires quickness, footwork, and a deep understanding of the fundamentals. An individual defender 
                works with his teammates to stifle scoring opportunities such as an open jump shot or lay up, box out
                to prevent an offensive rebound, and avoid fouling that will lead to a free throw. Ideally, a defense 
                will secure a turnover, leading to a defensive possession in which the team can run a full-court fast
                break to set up a quick pull-up three-point shot. Basketball coaches typically assign their 
                best defensive player to guard and close out the opposing teamâ€™s point guard, a ball-handling position 
                that is often the highest scorer in the lineup. <br>
